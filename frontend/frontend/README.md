# Smart Summary – Frontend

This is the **frontend interface** of the Smart Summary system — a full-stack AI-based video summarization tool.  
It allows users to upload video files and request context-specific summaries through a clean and responsive interface.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- React (via Create React App)
-  TailwindCSS (for minimal, responsive design)
-  Fetch API (to communicate with backend)
-  Modular components (`UploadBox`, `InputField`, etc.)

---

##  Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

npm install

### 2. Start the development server
npm start
The app will run on: http://localhost:3000

### Communication with Backend
This interface sends a POST request to the backend API at:

http://localhost:5236/pipeline/run
With the following JSON body:
{
  "videoName": "yourfile.mp4",
  "question": "your topic or question"
}
The backend returns a context-specific Turkish summary in response.
